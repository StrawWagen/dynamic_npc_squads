Algorithm that effectively gives Half-Life 2 NPCs some large-scale tactics.

With this, NPCs will join open squads dynamically, form their own squads.  
Squad leaders will wander around, call for backup, basically explore the map to find and fight threats.  
Squad followers will stick to their leader intelligently, watching guard randomly, sprinting to catch back up, and then walking slowly when they don't need to run anymore.    

Includes some extra features like;  
A framework to play proper lines, sounds on NPCs so they can somewhat communicate these custom behaviours to players.  
A "dynsquad goal" (think capture point!) that servers as an example of how to use the backup system to call squads around the map.  
Entirely npc:Disposition()-based team system, no hardcoded teams!
